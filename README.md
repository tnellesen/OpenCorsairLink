# OpenCorsairLink

I (Audiohacked) have decided to retire OpenCorsairLink. The Reasons for this is:
 - I was the sole developer and with my job (Consultant) I have far less time to work on this project.
 - This project is written in C and thus hard(er) to program for most people.
 - Most of the support was through reverse engineering the iCUE/CorsairLink protocols as I bought the hardware.

As I am still a fan of Corsair Products, any work/development/reverse-engineering I do in the future will available at https://github.com/jonasmalacofilho/liquidctl. 

P.S. As of late I've already have been contributing to liquidctl. Python is so much easier to work with, and faster than when I first learned Python.
